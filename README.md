# TeleKINesis (Real-time Kinetic Voice Processing)

The implemented computer music system allows the performer to manage the processing his/her voice undergoes in real time via the simple motion of the hands. The architecture of such system involves an interaction system unit, represented by a Microsoft Kinect sensor, a computer music unit consisting of a SuperCollider script and a graphical feedback unit, i.e. a GUI implemented via a Processing script.
